    <p>The following markup is generated by the TagField. It should look like a set of tags about something. The "remove" buttons are clickable, the input box should not be visible (except for the cursor and the text which the user will enter), and each tag should look like a separate entity, because tags might include spaces and other punctuation.</p>

    <div class="ink-tagfield">
        <span class="tag">cats<span class="remove">×</span></span>
        <span class="tag">lols<span class="remove">×</span></span>
        <span class="tag">photobombs<span class="remove">×</span></span>
        <span class="tag">famous people<span class="remove">×</span></span>
